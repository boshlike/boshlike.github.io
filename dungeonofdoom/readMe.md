# Welcome to the Dungeon of Doom
### Overview
A dark adn gritty story rich battling game inspired by classic JRPGs like Final Fantasy. You take the role of the nameless protagonist who must quest to save his family. The tone is deliberately dark adn macabre, bringing into line with more modern games such as Dark Souls.


The game has 3 levels with transitional scenes between each as well as a prologue and epilogue.
