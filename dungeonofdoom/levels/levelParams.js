        "You awake to the sound of screams and battle. The smell of burning in the air and the glow of fire on the night sky. You run to the window and look outside. The village is burning and horrors move in an our of the flickering shadows, butchering your friends and neighbours.",
        "A banging shakes the door of your cottage in its hinges. Dust puffs from the frame and someone (or something) tries to batter down the door. You hear a groan from outside and a barely human voice whispering in a strange hypnotic cadence.", 
        "Without thinking, you run to your daughter’s room and shake her from her slumber. Her eyes look back at you in terror as you whisper to her to remain quiet and come with you. Just as you head to the back room and the back door, you hear a huge crash and the shuffling of dead things entering your house. You run to the back door and fling it open to the end of the world.",
        "As you hesitate, stunned at the brutality on display around you, you feel cold claws grip you from behind in a vice like grip, dragging you to the floor and away from your daughter as she screams and reaches for you.",
        "A sharp blow is dealt to the back of your head and the last thing you see before losing consciousness is a robed figure, flanked by undead, dragging your daughter out of the village. You hear the robed figure hiss “Leave him alive, his suffering will be delicious.”",
        "You awake in the morning, a light rain on your face that has doused the worst of the fires, leaving the ruins of the village smouldering in the thin morning light. You look around and see hopelessness on the face of the people as they come to terms with their own grief and loss.",
        "But you are not one to grieve. You are terror of demons, the banisher of undead. You are the light in the darkness. The necromancy will pay for his transgressions.",
        "You rise, walk into the remains of your cottage and open the hidden trap door under the rug. You calmly and methodically pull our your sword, shield and armour, strap it to your body and march out of the village, following the trail of destruction left by those that took your daughter...",
        "You know where they are headed.",
        "Crandalholme Castle."
